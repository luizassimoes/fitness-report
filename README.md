# Fitness Report for Apple Watch

Get your year stats here! See how much you pushed yourself this year with a detailed report containing time, mileage, calories, and heart rate information!

### Motivation:

Do you know how we all just love Spotify Wrapped? I always try to think about other apps that could have a “wrap, " and it hit me the other day: I always start and stop my watch every time I work out. Why don’t we have a wrap for that?

### Details

All you need to do is extract the health data from your account and submit it to the app, then we do the work! You can see more detailed instructions on the app page.
