# Fitness Report for Apple Watch

Get your year stats here! See how much you pushed yourself this year with a detailed report containing time, mileage, calories, and heart rate information!
Go to [fitness-report.streamlit.app](https://fitness-report.streamlit.app/)!


### Motivation:

Every December, I get excited about Spotify Wrapped — it is like a recap of my year, and it makes me relive the fun moments. That gets me thinking: Why don’t other apps do something similar?
As someone who starts and stops their watch religiously for every workout, I wanted to see a Wrapped for my fitness journey, but Apple Health did not have it. Then, in true “shower thoughts” fashion, inspiration struck: “I can build that!”


### Details

All you need to do is extract the health data from your account and submit it to the app, then we do the work! You can see more detailed instructions on the app's page or through [this LinkedIn post]([https://www.linkedin.com/in/luizassimoes/](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/luizassimoes_datavisualization-dataanalysis-python-activity-7282161729596252162-S5ah?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop)).
